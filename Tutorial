type make_script to start creating it make sure ai says somthing to name it if it does not then say the name by typing name=(your name)
and then the rest are by saying show_commands or show_rules if you want to see both then show_rule+command hope you have fun
also type Add the command and rule vault in the txt to where they are supposed to be to set it up after pasting it
dont do copy raw for some reson it only does all until command 9 so gotta copy all using your fingers or mouse
